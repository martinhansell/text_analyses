                               INTRODUCTION
              Long ago in Greece, Hermia and Lysander decide
          to elope. Demetrius, who loves Hermia, follows them
          into the woods, hoping to stop them. Helena, who is
          in love with Demetrius, also follows.
              In the woods are a group of fairies and several
          craftsmen, rehearsing a play.
              Puck, one of the fairies, tricks each character into
          falling in love with the first person he or she sees upon
          awakening. All sorts of humorous confusion follows.

                    ACT

                     1                      Scene 1

            (Theseus and Hippolyta, along with their servants,
            enter Theseus’s palace in Athens.)
            THESEUS : Now, fair Hippolyta, our wedding
                hour draws near. Four more days!
               Time seems to go so slowly.
            HIPPOLYTA : Four days will quickly become night.
               Four nights will dream away the time.
               And then the new moon, like a silver bow,
               Shall look on our wedding night.
            THESEUS : Go, Philostrate.
               Stir up the youth of Athens to be merry.
               Awaken the spirit of fun.
               Tell all sadness to go to funerals.
               We don’t want any sad faces at our
                 wedding. (Philostrate exits.)
               Hippolyta, I wooed you with my sword
               In the heat of battle, and won your love
                 while defeating you.
               But I will wed you in a different way—
               With celebration, joy, and good times.
            (Egeus and his daughter Hermia enter, along with
            Lysander and Demetrius.)

          A MIDSUMMER NIGHT’S DREAM



          EGEUS : Joy to Theseus, our respected Duke!
          THESEUS : Thank you, good Egeus.
             What’s the news with you?
          EGEUS : I am having trouble with my child,
             My daughter Hermia.
             This man, Demetrius, has my consent to
               marry her.
             But you, Lysander, have cast a spell on her!
             (turning to Lysander) You have given her
               poetry and exchanged tokens of love with
               my child;
             You have sung insincere songs of love by
               her window in the moonlight.
             You have given her rings, flowers, and candy.
             You have used all the tricks young men use
             On young girls like my daughter.
             You have stolen my daughter’s heart
             And made her disobedient to me.
             Now she refuses to marry Demetrius.
             I claim my ancient right as a father:
             As she is mine, I may give her to the man
               I choose or send her to her death.
             This is the law of our land, as you know.
          THESEUS : What do you say, Hermia?
             Let me remind you, fair maid,
             Your father should be as a god to you.
             He is the one who formed your beauty.
             To him, you are but as a form in wax

               That he has shaped. It is within his rights
               To leave the form as it is or destroy it.
               Demetrius is a good man.
            HERMIA : So is Lysander.
            THESEUS : In himself he is. But, in this case,
               Because of your father’s wishes,
               The other must be seen as the better man.
            HERMIA : I wish my father saw it with my eyes.
            THESEUS : Rather, you must see it his way.
            HERMIA : I beg your grace to pardon me.
               I do not know if it is proper for me
               To explain my thoughts to you.
               But I beg you to answer one question:
               What is the worst that could happen to me
               If I refuse to wed Demetrius?
            THESEUS : Either to die or never to marry at all.
               Think hard, fair Hermia!
               Consider your youth and your feelings.
               Ask yourself if you could live as a nun.
               Could you be a childless sister all your life,
               Singing weak songs to the cold, lifeless moon?
               Those who can do so are certainly blessed.
               But would you be happy with such a life?
            HERMIA : So will I live—or die—my lord,
               Before I would marry a man I do not love.
            THESEUS : Take time to think about this.
               Tell us your answer in four days,

             On the wedding day of my love and me.
             By then you must prepare to die
             For going against your father’s will—
             Or wed Demetrius, as your father wishes.
             Or live as a nun for the rest of your life.
          DEMETRIUS : Give in, sweet Hermia.
             And you, too, Lysander.
             Let me claim what is rightly mine.
          LYSANDER : You have her father’s love, Demetrius.
             Let me have Hermia’s. You marry him.
          EGEUS : It is true—Demetrius has my love.
             And so, I shall give him what is mine.
             Hermia belongs to me. All my rights to her
             I give to Demetrius.

                                                  Act 1 • Scene 1



            LYSANDER : My lord, I am as good a man as he!
               My family is as well-connected as his.
               I have as much money as he.
               My love is greater than his.
               In every way, I am at least as good as he is,
               And in some ways, I am better.
               The beautiful Hermia loves me,
               Which is the most important point.
               Why shouldn’t I return her love?
               Demetrius courted Nedar’s daughter,
                 Helena, and won her soul.
               She still loves this faithless man.
            THESEUS : I have meant to talk to Demetrius
                about it.
               But I’ve been so busy that I forgot to
                 do so.
               Come with me, Demetrius.
               You, too, Egeus. I must talk to you
                 privately.
               As for you, fair Hermia, try
               To fit your wishes to those of your father.
               Otherwise the law of Athens will go
                 against you.
               We can do nothing about it—
               You must die or vow to live a single life.
               Come, my Hippolyta.
               Demetrius and Egeus, you come, too.
               I must talk to you about our wedding
               And about something else that concerns you.

          EGEUS : We are happy to go with you, my lord.

          (All but Lysander and Hermia exit.)
          LYSANDER : My love! Why is your face so pale?
             How did your rosy cheeks fade so fast?
          HERMIA : Perhaps it is from lack of rain.
             Only my tears water them.
          LYSANDER : Oh, my! From everything that I’ve
              learned,
             The course of true love never did run
               smooth.
          HERMIA : Oh, awful! To choose love by
              another’s eyes.
          LYSANDER : War or death may stand in the way.
             Love lasts just a moment, like a sound.
             It is swift as a shadow, short as any dream
             And as quick as lightning in a storm
             That, in a rage, splits heaven and earth.
             Before a person can say, “Look at that!”
             The jaws of darkness eat it up.
          HERMIA : If this is truly what love is,
             It must be law. So we must be patient
             And give to love our thoughts and dreams,
             Our wishes and tears.
          LYSANDER : Good advice, Hermia. Now, hear me.
             I have a rich old aunt.
             She’s a widow with no children.
             Her house is only 20 miles from Athens.

               She thinks of me as her only son.
               There, gentle Hermia, we can get married.
               Athenian law cannot touch us there.
               If you love me, leave your father’s house
               Tomorrow night. Meet me in the woods,
               Three miles outside of town.
               Remember where I met you with Helena
               To gather May flowers one morning?
               That’s where I will wait for you.
            HERMIA : My good Lysander! I swear to you by
                Cupid’s strongest bow, and
               By his best arrow, with the golden tip—
               By all that keeps lovers’ souls together—
               And by all the vows that men have broken
               (Which are more than women ever made)—
               Tomorrow I truly will meet you there.
            LYSANDER : Keep your promise, love.
               Look, here comes Helena.
            (Helena enters.)
            HERMIA : Hello, fair Helena!
            HELENA : You call me “fair”? You don’t mean it.
               Demetrius loves your fairness. You are
                 lucky! To him, your eyes are like stars.
               Oh, were beauty as catching as sickness!
               I would want to catch yours, fair Hermia.
               If the world were mine, and Demetrius, too,
               I’d give you the world and keep Demetrius.

             Oh, teach me how to look like you, and how
             To lead the dancing of Demetrius’s heart!
          HERMIA : He loves me though I frown upon
              him!
          HELENA : I wish your frowns would teach my
              smiles such skill!
          HERMIA : The more I reject him, the more he
              loves me.
          HELENA : The more I love him, the more he
              rejects me.
          HERMIA : He’s a fool, Helena! It’s not my fault.
          HELENA : It’s the fault of your beauty. I wish
              that fault were mine!
          HERMIA : Be happy. He won’t see me again.
             Lysander and I will soon leave this place.
             Before I saw Lysander,
             Athens seemed a paradise to me.
             But I don’t feel that way anymore.
          LYSANDER : Helena, here’s our plan:
             Tomorrow night, when the moon sees
             Her silver face in the water,
             We will steal away from Athens.
          HERMIA : There we will meet new people and
              seek new friends.
             Goodbye, sweet childhood friend. Pray for us.
             And good luck with your Demetrius!
             Keep your word, Lysander, dear.

                 may he also love you. (Lysander exits.)
            HELENA : Some are so much happier than
                others!
               In Athens, I am thought as fair as she. But
                 what of that? Demetrius doesn’t think so.
               He does not see what everyone else does.
               I love him just as he loves Hermia.
               Love looks not with the eyes, but with
                 the mind.
               That’s why Cupid is always painted blind.
               And that’s why love is said to be a child—
               Because its choices are often so wild.
               Love often lies. Before Demetrius saw
                 Hermia,
               He swore that he was only mine.
            (Suddenly Helena thinks of a way to see Demetrius
            again.)
               I will go tell him of fair Hermia’s plan.
               He will follow her tomorrow night.
               He might even thank me for the news.
               If he does, I will not mind the pain,
               For perhaps I can get his attention again.
            (Helena exits.)

          A MIDSUMMER NIGHT’S DREAM



                                Scene 2
          (Peter Quince, Snug, Bottom, Flute, Snout, and
          Starveling enter Peter Quince’s house in Athens.)
          QUINCE : Are all the actors here?
          BOTTOM : It would be best if you would call their
              names, man by man, following your list.
          QUINCE : Here is the scroll of every man in
              Athens who is fit to act in our play.
              We will put on this play for the duke
              and duchess on their wedding night.
          BOTTOM : First, good Peter Quince, say what
              the play is about. Then read the names of
              the actors. That way you get to the point.
          QUINCE : All right. Our play is “The Most Sad
              Comedy and Most Cruel Death of
              Pyramus and Thisbe.”
          BOTTOM : A very good piece of work! Now, good
              Peter Quince, call your list of actors.
          QUINCE : I call Nick Bottom, the weaver.
          BOTTOM : Ready. Name my part, and go on.
          QUINCE : You, Nick Bottom, are set down for
              Pyramus.
          BOTTOM : Who is Pyramus—a lover or a hero?
          QUINCE : A lover. He kills himself for love.
          BOTTOM : That will cause some tears. If I do it,
              let the audience take care of their eyes. I

                 will move storms! I will make them all
                 feel sad! Yet I’d rather be a hero. I could
                 play Hercules really well. That’s a part I
                 could really sink my teeth into! A hero is
                 a great role. A lover is more to be pitied.
                 Now name the rest of the players.
            QUINCE : Francis Flute, the bellows-mender.
            FLUTE : Here, Peter Quince.
            QUINCE : Flute, you will play the role of Thisbe.
            FLUTE : What is Thisbe? A wandering knight?
            QUINCE : Thisbe is the lady that Pyramus loves.
            FLUTE : No, I don’t want to play a woman.
                 Look! I have a beard coming in.
            QUINCE : No matter. You shall wear a mask,
                 and you may speak as small as you want.
            BOTTOM : Let me play Thisbe, too. I’ll speak in
                 a tiny little voice.
               (speaking in a loud voice): “Thisbe! Thisbe!”
               (then speaking in a small voice): “Oh, Pyramus,
                  my dear lover! I am your lady Thisbe!”
            QUINCE : No, no, you must play Pyramus.
                 Flute, you will play Thisbe.
            BOTTOM : Well, go on.
            QUINCE : Robin Starveling, you must play
                 Thisbe’s mother. Next, Tom Snout, the
                 tinker.
            SNOUT : Here, Peter Quince.

          QUINCE : You will play Pyramus’s father. I will
               play Thisbe’s father. Snug, the joiner, you
               will play the lion’s part. I hope these
               parts work out for all of us.
          SNUG : Do you have a written copy of the
               lion’s part? If you do, please give it to me
               now, for I learn slowly.
          QUINCE : But it is nothing but roaring!
          BOTTOM : Let me play the lion too! My roar
               will do any man’s heart good. My roar
               will make the duke say, “Let him roar
               again. Let him roar again!”
          QUINCE : But you would frighten the duchess
               and the ladies. They would scream. That
               would be reason enough to hang us all.
          ALL : That would hang us, every mother’s son.
          BOTTOM : It’s true, friends. If you should
               frighten the ladies, they would surely
               hang us! But I will roar as gently as any
               baby dove. I will roar like a nightingale.
          QUINCE : You can play no part but Pyramus,
               for Pyramus is as sweet and proper a
               man as you would see on a summer day.
               That is why you must play this lovely
               gentleman.
               (handing out the parts): Gentlemen, here
               are your parts. I beg you to learn them

          (In a wood near Athens, a fairy enters at one door,
          and Puck enters at another.)
          PUCK : Hello, spirit! Where do you wander?
          FAIRY : Over hill, over dale,
            Through bush, through briar,
            Over field, over fence,
            Through flood, through fire,
            I do wander everywhere,
            Faster than the moon.
            And I serve the fairy queen.
            I place her drops of dew upon the grass.
            The tall flowers depend on her.
            In their gold coats, you see tiny spots.
            Those are rubies, fairy favors.
            In those freckles lie the flowers’ aromas.
            I must go find some dewdrops here.
            And hang a pearl in every flower’s ear.
            Goodbye, lively spirit! Our queen and all
              her elves will be here soon.
          PUCK : The king gives a party here tonight.

               For Oberon is very angry. The queen has
                 stolen a lovely boy from a king in India.
               She wants him as her servant.
               But jealous Oberon wants the child
               To serve as a knight in the wild forests.
               Yet she keeps the favored boy to herself.
               She crowns him with flowers. He’s her joy.
               Now, every time the king and queen meet,
               In wood or field, by clear water, or in
                 starlight, they argue over the boy.
               All their elves, out of fear,
               Creep into acorn cups and hide there.
            FAIRY : If I’m not wrong, I know you.
               Aren’t you that clever, naughty sprite
               Called Robin Goodfellow? Aren’t you he
               Who frightens the girls in the village?
               Don’t you steal cream from milk,
               And play tricks on housewives?
               Do you not lead travelers the wrong way,
               Laughing when they get lost?
               You’re the one they call “Sweet Puck”!
            PUCK : You speak the truth.
               I am that merry wanderer of the night.
               I joke with Oberon, and make him smile.
               A wise old woman, telling a sad story,
               Sometimes thinks I am a three-legged
                 stool—until I slip out from under her,
               And down she falls!

             Then everyone laughs and laughs!
             But look, fairy. Here comes Oberon.
          FAIRY : And here is Titania, too! I wish that
              Oberon were gone!
          (Oberon enters at one door, with his attendants.
          Titania enters at another door, with hers.)

              Titania.
          TITANIA : What, Oberon? Fairies, let’s go.
             I don’t want to see him, either.
          OBERON : Wait! Am I not your husband?
          TITANIA : Then I must be your wife. But I
              know how you sing songs of love to all
              the young girls.
             Are you back from India so soon?
             Have you come to see Hippolyta,
             Your old love, be married to Theseus?
             Did you come to wish them joy?
          OBERON : How can you say that? For shame,
             Titania, talking about my love for
               Hippolyta
             When I know of your love for Theseus!
             Didn’t you lead him to break his promises
             To so many women?

             Never, since the beginning of summer,
             Have we been able to dance freely

             We often talked as we sat side by side.
             She sat with me on the beach’s yellow sands,
               While we watched the tall ships.
             We’d laugh at their sails, full and big-bellied
             With the wind, as she was with that child.
             Pretending to be a ship, she would
             Sail upon the land and bring back gifts.
             But alas! She, being a mere mortal,
             Died when he was born.
             It is for her sake that I raise the boy.
             And for her sake I will not part with him.

              She was singing such a sweet song
              That the rude sea grew calm to hear it.
              Certain stars shot madly from their orbits
              To hear the mermaid’s music.
            PUCK : I remember.

              Flying between moon and earth.
              He took aim at a fair maiden below
              And fired his love arrow at her heart.
              But she moved out of the way, and
              Cupid’s arrow missed her.
              I watched the arrow fall on a white flower,
              Now made purple by love’s wound.
              Young girls call this flower “Love-in-
                idleness.”
              Get that flower I once showed you.
              The juice of it, laid on sleeping eyes,
              Will make the soul fall madly in love
              With the next live creature it sees.
              Get it for me! Be back here again
              Before a whale can swim three miles.

              In 40 minutes.

             And drop it on her eyes. When she wakes,
             She’ll love the first thing she sees.
             It might be a lion, a bear, a wolf, or a bull.
             It might be a monkey or an ape. Whatever
               it is, she shall chase it with love.

             Go away, Helena! Follow me no more.
          HELENA : You draw me like a magnet. My heart
             Is true as steel. Lose your power to draw,
             And I shall have no power to follow you.
          DEMETRIUS : Draw you? Haven’t I spoken fairly?
             Haven’t I told you the truth?
             The fact is that I do not and cannot love you.
          HELENA : And for that, I love you all the more.
             I am your dog, Demetrius. The more you
               beat me, the more I will follow.
             Treat me as you wish. Just let me,
             Unworthy as I am, follow you.
          DEMETRIUS : It makes me sick to look at you.
          HELENA : And I feel sick when I don’t look at you!

                                                  Act 2 • Scene 1



            DEMETRIUS : How can you chase after someone
               Who does not love you? Do you trust the
                 night and this lonely place for safety?
            HELENA : Your virtue will keep me safe.
               It is not night when I can see your face.
               So I think I am not in the night.
               And this wood does not seem lonely,
               For you, in my view, are all the world.
               Then how can it be said I am alone
               When all the world is here to look on me?
            DEMETRIUS : I’ll run and hide in the bushes
               And leave you to the mercy of wild beasts.
            HELENA : The wildest has a kinder heart than you.
               Run if you wish. I’ll change the story.
               The deer can catch the tiger
               When cowardice chases and bravery runs.
            DEMETRIUS : I won’t listen anymore. Let me go.
               Or, if you follow me, do not doubt that
               I will do you harm in the wood.
            HELENA : Yes, in the temple, the town, the field,
               You do me harm! For shame, Demetrius!
               Your wrongs offend all women.
               We cannot fight for love, as men may do;
               We were not made to woo.
            (Demetrius exits.)
               I’ll follow you, and make a heaven of hell,
               If I die by the hand I love so well.

          OBERON : Farewell, sweet girl.
             Before Demetrius leaves this grove,
             You will run, and he will seek your love.
          (Puck enters again.)
            Welcome, wanderer. Do you have the
              flower?
          PUCK : Yes, here it is.
          OBERON : Please, give it to me.
            I know a bank where the wild thyme blows,
            Where every kind of lovely flower grows.
            There Titania often sleeps at night,
            Tired from dances and delight;
            With the juice of this I’ll streak her eyes,
            And make her full of hateful fantasies.
             (He gives Puck some of the flower.)
            Take this and find in this grove
            A sweet Athenian lady who is in love
            With a man who hates her. Paint his eyes!
            But do it when the next thing he sees
            Will be the lady. You will know this man
            By the Athenian clothes he wears.
            Do this deed with care. Make sure he will
            Love her more than she loves him.
            Meet me here before the first rooster-crow.
          PUCK : Fear not, my lord. Your servant shall obey.

            (In another part of the wood, Titania enters, along
            with her fairies.)
            TITANIA : Come now, a dance and a fairy song.
               Then, for a while, go away from here.
               (She points to different fairies.)
               You will kill the worms that eat the roses.
               You will war with bats for their wings
               To make coats for my elves.
               You will keep back the noisy owls that
               Come here at night and hoot at us.
               Sing me now to sleep.
               Then do your jobs and let me rest.
            (The fairies sing.)
            FAIRIES : You snakes with double tongues,
               Skunks and beetles, don’t be seen.
               Worms and lizards, do no wrong,
               Don’t come near our fairy Queen.

             Love and suffer for his sake.
             Be it pig, or cat, or bear,
             In your eyes it will appear,
             When you wake, as your own dear.
             Wake when something vile is near.
          (Oberon exits. Hermia and Lysander enter.)
          LYSANDER : Fair love, you are weak
             From wandering in the wood.
             To tell the truth, I have lost our way.
             We’ll rest here, Hermia, if you think it good.
             Let us wait here for the light of day.
          HERMIA : Good, Lysander. Find yourself a bed.
             Upon this bank I will rest my head.
          LYSANDER : One spot can serve as pillow for us
              both. Our hearts are as one.
          HERMIA : No, Lysander. For my sake, my dear,
             Lie farther off yet. Do not lie so near.
          LYSANDER : Do not take me wrong, my sweet!
             I mean that my soul is one with yours.
             So let me make my bedroom by your side.
             For lying that way, Hermia, I have not lied.
          HERMIA : Lysander, you make a pretty riddle.
             Now forgive my manners and my pride,
             If Hermia meant to say Lysander lied!
             But, gentle friend, lie farther off.
             Such separation may well be said to be
               right for an unmarried man and a maid.

               So stay at a distance—and good night,
                sweet friend.
               May our love not change until life’s end!

               But I have found no Athenian
               On whose eyes I might pour
               The loving juice of this flower.
            (He comes upon Lysander and Hermia.)
               Night and silence! Who is here?
               Clothes of Athens he does wear!
               This is the man my master said
               Hated the Athenian maid.
               And here is the maiden, sleeping sound
               On the damp and dirty ground.
               Pretty soul! She should not lie
               Near this man with no courtesy.
            (He puts the flower juice on Lysander’s eyes.)
               Oaf! Upon your eyes I now throw
               All the power this charm does know.
               When you wake, let love keep
               You so alert you cannot sleep.

               Happy is Hermia, wherever she lies,
               For she has blessed and pretty eyes.
               Her eyes did not get bright with tears.
               If so, mine would be prettier than hers.
               No, no, I am as ugly as a bear,
               For beasts that meet me run away in fear;
               So I don’t wonder why Demetrius does
               Like a monster, run from me thus.
            (She sees Lysander sleeping.)
               But who is here? Lysander, on the ground!
               Dead, or asleep? I see no blood, no wound.

               Where is Demetrius? Oh, that vile word!
               That name should perish on my sword!
            HELENA : Do not say that, Lysander.
               What does it matter that he loves your
                 Hermia? Fair Hermia still loves you.
                 So be happy.
            LYSANDER : Happy with Hermia? I’m sorry now
               For all the boring minutes I’ve spent with her.
               I do not love Hermia! It is Helena I love.
               Who would not trade a raven for a dove?
               By reason is a man’s heart swayed,
               And reason says you are the worthier maid.
               So far young reason has not been ripe.

             And reason leads me to your eyes. There I
               see love’s stories in love’s richest book.

             What did I do to deserve such treatment?
             Isn’t it enough, young man, that I never can
             Get a sweet look from Demetrius’s eye?
             Now I must hear you make sport of me?
             Goodbye! I must say that, before this,
             I thought you were a gentleman.

             My stomach is deeply sick of you.

             To honor Helena, and be her knight!

              for our rehearsal. This green area shall be

          QUINCE : What do you say, Bottom?
          BOTTOM : There are things in this comedy of
              Pyramus and Thisbe that will never do.
              First, Pyramus must draw a sword to kill
              himself. The ladies won’t want to see
              such a thing! What do you say to that?
          STARVELING : I believe we must leave the killing
              out, when all is said and done.
          BOTTOM : Not at all! I have a plan that will
              make it all well. Write a prologue for me
              to speak. Let the prologue say that we
              will do no harm with our swords. Say

                that Pyramus is not really killed. And
                just to make sure—say that I, Pyramus,
                am not Pyramus but Bottom the weaver.
                This will make everyone feel better.

            STARVELING : I know that I will!
            BOTTOM : You are right. To bring a lion in
                among ladies would be most dreadful!
                We should think about this.
            SNOUT : We must say he that he’s not a lion!
            BOTTOM : No, you must say his name, and half
                his face must show through the lion’s
                neck. He himself should say something
                like this: “Ladies,” or “Fair ladies, I
                would wish you—” No, maybe it should
                be this: “I would ask you,” or “I beg you
                not to fear! If you think I am a lion, you
                are wrong. No, I am no such thing. I am
                a man like any other.” And then, let him
                say his name, and tell them plainly that
                he is Snug the joiner.
            QUINCE : Very well, it shall be so. But there are
                still two problems. First, how will we bring
                moonlight in the room? As you know,
                Pyramus and Thisbe meet by moonlight.
            SNOUT : Will the moon shine the night we are
                to present our play?

              the moon will be shining.
          QUINCE (taking out a calendar): Yes, it does shine
              that night.
          BOTTOM : Why, then we may leave a window
              open in the room where we perform. The
              moon will shine in at the window.
          QUINCE : Yes, and someone can come in dressed
              as the Man in the Moon. He could say
              he represents the moon. Then there is
              one more thing: We need a wall in the
              room. The story says that Pyramus and
              Thisbe talked through a hole in a wall.
          SNOUT : You can never bring in a wall. What
              do you think, Bottom?
          BOTTOM : One of us must play the wall. He
              can have plaster or some mud on him, to
              show he’s a wall. Let him hold his fingers
              open like this, and Pyramus and Thisbe
              can whisper through that hole.
          QUINCE : If that would work, then all is well.
              Come, sit down, every mother’s son, and
              rehearse your parts. Pyramus, you begin.
              When you have said your lines, go offstage.
              Everyone else, do the same.

              What—a play? I’ll be the audience and
              Perhaps an actor, too, if I see the need.
            QUINCE : Speak, Pyramus. Thisbe, get ready.
            BOTTOM (as Pyramus): Thisbe, as sweet as the
                flowers smell, so is your breath.
              But listen! A voice! Stay here awhile
              And soon I will appear to you.
            (Bottom exits, into the bushes.)
            PUCK (aside): A stranger Pyramus has never
                been played!
            (Puck exits, following Bottom.)
            FLUTE : Must I speak now?
            QUINCE : Yes, you must. You must understand
                that he goes only to see about a noise he
                heard. He will soon return.
            FLUTE (as Thisbe): Pyramus, white as a red rose,
               Young, lovely, and as true as the truest horse,
               I’ll meet you at Ninny’s tomb.
            QUINCE (exploding): “Ninus’s” tomb, man! And
                you don’t say that line just yet. That’s
                what you answer to Pyramus. Pyramus,
                you must enter. You missed your cue.
                Your cue is “truest horse.”

               yours alone.
          QUINCE (frightened by the donkey’s head): Oh, a
               monster! We are haunted! Help!

          leaving only Bottom and Puck.)

             Through swamps, bushes, and woods.
             Sometimes I’ll be a horse, sometimes a dog,
             A hog, a headless bear, sometimes a fire.
             I’ll neigh, bark, grunt, roar, and burn,
             Like horse, dog, hog, bear, fire!

             head like your own, don’t you?

                place, no matter what they do. I will
                walk up and down here, and I will sing.

                full of delight at the sound you make.
               My eye is delighted by your fine looks.
               Everything about you moves me
               To swear I love you at first sight!
            BOTTOM : I think, lady, you have little reason
                for that. And yet, to tell the truth, reason
                and love are not good friends these days.
                It’s a shame that people won’t link them.
                That’s just a little joke!
            TITANIA : You are as wise as you are beautiful.

                enough to get out of this wood, that
                would be good enough for me.

              want to or not.
             I am no common spirit.
             The summer is a servant to me.

          (Oberon enters another part of the wood.)
          OBERON : I wonder if Titania is awake yet.
             If so, I wonder what came to her eyes next,
             That she now must love dearly?
          (Puck enters.)
            Here’s my messenger. How now, mad spirit?
            What mischief have you brought?
          PUCK : Your wife is in love with a monster.
            Near her chambers, while she was sleeping,
            I saw a crew of workers—rude men
            Who work for their bread in Athenian stalls.
            They had met to rehearse a play to act
            On Theseus’s wedding day.
            The most stupid and shallow one of them,
            Acting the part of Pyramus, left the stage
            And went into the bushes.
            That is when I got my chance with him.
            I set a donkey’s head on his shoulders.
            Soon his Thisbe called him. At this cue,
            He left the bushes and went back to the
              grassy stage. The other actors saw him
            With the donkey’s head. Afraid of him,
            They flew like wild geese from a hunter.
            They rose and quacked and ran screaming.
              One fell and cried out, “Murder!”
            Their sense was weak, their fears were strong.

              They began to think that the bushes and
                thorns were grabbing at their clothes.
              I led them on in their wild, confused fear
              And left sweet Pyramus, changed, there.
              Just at that moment, it came to be
              That Titania woke, and loved a donkey.
            OBERON : This is better than I expected!
              But have you sprinkled the Athenian’s eyes
              With the love-juice, as I told you to?
            PUCK : Yes, that’s done, too. The Athenian
               woman was by his side. So, when he
               awoke, he must have seen her first.
            (Demetrius and Hermia enter.)
            OBERON : Hide yourself! Here comes the same
               Athenian.
            PUCK : But it’s not the same man!
            DEMETRIUS : Why be so cruel to one who loves
               you so?
              You should be so bitter with a bitter foe!
            HERMIA : I’ve been patient until now, but I
               should treat you worse.
              For you have given me reason to curse.
              Have you killed Lysander in his sleep?
              Have your shoes stood in his blood?
              If so, your knife should kill me, too.
              The sun was not so true as he to me.
              Would he have left me sleeping in the wood?

            I’d sooner believe that I could dig a hole
            In the earth for the moon to shine through.
            It must be that you have murdered him!
            You look like a murderer—so dead, so grim.
          DEMETRIUS : The victim would look dead,
            And so should I.

            Yet you, the murderer, look as bright

          HERMIA : Out, dog! You push me past the bounds
            Of my patience. Have you killed him, then?
            If so, you don’t deserve to be called a man!
            Oh, tell me the truth, for my own sake!
            Did you kill him while he was sleeping?
            Oh, you brave one! A snake could do as
              much! Yes, a snake did it!
            There was never a snake as bad as you!
          DEMETRIUS : You are wasting your anger on me.
            I did not kill Lysander.
            He is not dead, as far as I know.

            LYSANDER : Demetrius loves Hermia, not you.
            DEMETRIUS (waking up and seeing Helena): Helena,
                my goddess! You are perfect, divine!
               To what shall I compare your eyes?
               Crystal is dull compared to them.
               Your lips, like cherries, perfect to kiss!
               When I see your hand, pure white snow
               On high mountains seems black.
               Oh, let me kiss your white hand now!
            HELENA (to both men): Oh, wickedness!
               I see you both are making fun of me now.
               If you were kind and had some manners,
               You would not do this to me.
               You must hate me to mock me this way.
               If you were men, as you both seem to be,
               You would not abuse a gentle lady
               With your false promises and praise!
               I know you both love Hermia.
               What a manly game—to make fun of a
                 poor maid and make her cry!
               No gentleman would act that way.

          A MIDSUMMER NIGHT’S DREAM



          LYSANDER : You are not kind, Demetrius.
             Don’t be that way. You love Hermia.
             You and I both know it. And here, with
               all good will, with all my heart,
             I give up my claim to her. She’s yours.
             So now give up your claim to Helena.
             I love her and will love her until death!
          HELENA : Never did fools waste more breath!
          DEMETRIUS : Lysander, keep your Hermia.
             If I ever loved her, all that love is gone.
             My heart only stayed with her as a guest;
             It has come home to Helena.
          LYSANDER : Helena, it is not so.
          DEMETRIUS : Don’t talk about things you don’t
              know. Your words can put you in danger,
              and you may have to pay for them.
             Look who’s coming—it is your love.
          (Hermia enters.)
          HERMIA : Dark night takes away the eye’s power,
             And makes it easier for ears to work.
               As much as it hurts the sense of sight,
               it doubles the sense of hearing.
             I did not find you through my eyes.
             My ears brought me to you, Lysander.
             Why did you leave me that way?
          LYSANDER : Why should I stay, when love for
              another fair maid is pushing me to go?

            HERMIA : What love could steal you from me?
            LYSANDER : My love for fair Helena, who makes
                the night brighter than all the stars.
               Why are you looking for me?
               Couldn’t you see
               That I left you because I despise you?
            HERMIA : You do not mean this! It can’t be true.
            HELENA : Look, she is part of their plan!
               Now I see that all three have joined
               To make fun of me! Hurtful Hermia!
               Most ungrateful friend! In spite of
                 everything we two have shared, you treat
                 me this way? We were like sisters!
               We spent hours together!
               We would feel sad that time was hurrying by
               And parting us. Have you forgotten all
                 our school-days’ friendship? Hermia, we
                 have embroidered one flower together on
                 one sampler, sitting on one pillow.
               We have sung one song, both in one key,
               As if our hands, our sides, voices, and minds
               Were one. We were like two lovely berries
               Growing on one stem.
               We were two bodies with one heart!
               Now will you tear our old love apart,
               To join men in scorning your poor friend?
               It is not friendly—not how girls should be.
               Other women would agree with me

             Though I alone do feel the injury.
          HERMIA : I am amazed at your passion. I don’t
              scorn you. It seems that you scorn me.
          HELENA : Haven’t you sent Lysander after me
             To praise my eyes and face? Haven’t you also
             Sent your other love, Demetrius, to call
               me goddess and heavenly? Why does he
             Speak so to one he hates? And why does
             Lysander say he does not love you?
             Why does he declare his love for me,
               unless you told him to?
             I may not be as beautiful as you, or as
               lucky—so hung upon with love. But a
               person like me,
             So miserable, loving but not loved—
             Should be pitied rather than hated.
          HERMIA : I do not understand what you mean.
          HELENA : Yes, go on, with your fake sad looks.
             Make faces at me when I turn my back,
             Wink at each other. Keep the joke going.
             It will be written down in history.
             If you have any pity, grace, or manners,
             You would not treat me like this.
             Farewell. It’s partly my own fault.
             I’ll end it by leaving.
          LYSANDER : Stay, gentle Helena. Listen to me.
             My love, my life, my soul, fair Helena!
          HELENA (bitterly): Oh, that is excellent!

            HERMIA : Sweet, do not scorn her so.
            LYSANDER : Your threats are as weak as her prayers.
               Helena, I love you. I swear it by my life.
            DEMETRIUS : I say I love you more than he does.
            LYSANDER : If you say so, prove it.
            DEMETRIUS (getting ready to fight): I’d be glad to.
            HERMIA (taking hold of Lysander): Lysander, what
                is the point of all this?
            LYSANDER : Get away, monkey! Let go of me,
               Or I will shake you from me like a snake.
            HERMIA : Why have you grown so rude?
               Why have you changed so, sweet love?

            HERMIA : Are you joking?
            HELENA : Yes, indeed, and so are you.
            LYSANDER : Demetrius, my challenge stands.
               I will keep my word with you.
            DEMETRIUS : I wish I had it in writing.
               I do not trust your word.
            LYSANDER : What? Should I hurt her, strike her,
                kill her dead?
               Although I hate her, I’ll not harm her so.
            HERMIA : What? Can you hurt me any worse?
               Hate me! Why? What is going on, my love?
               Am I not Hermia? Are you not Lysander?
               I am the same as I was yesterday.

          A MIDSUMMER NIGHT’S DREAM



             Last night you loved me. Why did you go?
             Oh, the gods forbid! Are you serious?
          LYSANDER : Yes, by my life!
             I do not wish to see you anymore.
             So stop hoping, questioning, and doubting.
             Be sure. There is nothing truer. It is no joke
             That I do hate you and love Helena.
          HERMIA : Oh, me!
             (to Helena): You sneak! You thief of love!
             Have you come by night
             And stolen my love’s heart from him?
          HELENA : Fine, I see! Have you no shame?
             Would you tear angry answers from my
               gentle tongue? Shame, shame!
             You fake, you puppet, you!
          HERMIA : “Puppet?” So that is how the game
               goes. Now I see how she has won him.
             She has pointed out that she is taller than I.
             And have you grown so tall in his view
             Because I am so short? How short am I,
               you painted maypole? Speak!
             How short am I? I am not so short
             That my nails can’t reach your eyes!
          HELENA : Gentlemen, though you mock me,
             Do not let her hurt me. I have no gift for
               fighting. I am a lady, indeed. Don’t let

            HERMIA : “Lower?” Listen to her!
            HELENA : Please, do not be so bitter with me.
               I have always loved you, Hermia, and I
                 have never wronged you.
               The only thing I did, loving Demetrius,
               Was to tell him of your meeting in this
                 wood.
               He followed you. Out of love, I followed
                 him. But he has told me to leave. And
                 now, if you will let me go quietly,
               I will return my foolish love to Athens
                 and follow you no more.
               Let me go. That’s all I want now.
            HERMIA : Why, go on! What’s stopping you?
            HELENA : The foolish heart I leave behind.
            HERMIA : What? With Lysander?
            HELENA : With Demetrius.

                 you, Helena.

               She was a vixen when she was in school.
               She may be little, but she is fierce.

                 and “little”!

             Which one of us has more right to Helena.

              And so far I am glad that it was done—
              For watching them fight is so much fun.

              Go quickly, Puck, and make black the
                night. Lead these rivals so astray

              Talk like Lysander, and stir Demetrius up.
              Then talk like Demetrius, and stir up
                Lysander. Lead them back and forth
                until they fall in deathlike sleep.
              Then put this juice in Lysander’s eye.

              It has the power to undo errors.

              Will go back to Athens. They’ll always feel

              And not coming out? Come, you child,

          A MIDSUMMER NIGHT’S DREAM



            You keep running away. You don’t have
              the courage to look me in the face.
            Where are you now?
          PUCK (in Lysander’s voice): Come over here.
            Here I am.
          DEMETRIUS : No, you are mocking me.
            You shall pay for this,
            If I ever see your face by daylight!
            But for now, go your way.
            I must lie down on this cold bed
            And wait for the coming of day.
          (Demetrius lies down and sleeps. Helena enters.)
          HELENA : Oh, weary night! Oh, long, terrible
              night! Cut short your hours! Rise, sun, so
              I may go back to Athens by daylight,
              away from these people who hate me.
             Sleep, that sometimes shuts up sorrow’s eye,
             Take me awhile from my own company.
          (Helena lies down and sleeps.)
          PUCK : Only three? Come one more.
             Two of both kinds makes up four.
             Here she comes, hurt and sad.
             Cupid is a wicked lad,
             Thus to make poor females mad.
          (Hermia enters.)
          HERMIA : Never so tired, never so sad,

               Damp from the dew, and torn by thorns,
               I can go no farther. Here I will rest
               Till the break of day.
               Heaven protect Lysander if they fight!
            (Hermia lies down and sleeps.)
            PUCK : On the ground,
               Sleep sound.
               I’ll apply
               This to your eye.
            (He puts the juice on Lysander’s eyes.)
               When you wake,
               You will take
               Great delight
               In the sight
               Of your true love’s eyes.
               And a saying that is well-known—
               That every man should take his own—
               In your waking shall be shown:
               Jack shall have his Jill,
               Nothing shall go ill.
               The man shall have his mare again,
               And all shall be well.

          Hermia are lying on the ground, asleep. Enter Titania
          and Bottom, Peaseblossom, Cobweb, Moth, and
          Mustardseed, with other fairies. Oberon enters just
          behind, unseen by the others.)
          TITANIA (to Bottom): Come, sit on this flowery bed
             While I touch your lovely face.
             I’ll stick roses in your sleek, smooth hair
             And kiss your fair large ears, my gentle joy.
          BOTTOM : Where’s Peaseblossom?
          PEASEBLOSSOM : Ready.
          BOTTOM : Scratch my head, Peaseblossom.
             Where’s Mr. Cobweb?
          COBWEB : Ready.
          BOTTOM : Mr. Cobweb, get your bow and arrow
             And kill me a red-hipped honeybee
             On the top of a flower. Bring me the
               honeybag.
             Take care that it does not break or you’ll be
               covered with honey.

               And please, sir, stop bowing.
            MUSTARDSEED : What would you like?
            BOTTOM : Nothing, good sir, but a scratch.
               I must get to the barber’s, sir,
               For I think I have too much hair on my face.
               I am such a tender donkey.
               If my hair tickles me, I must scratch.
            TITANIA : Would you like some music, my love?
            BOTTOM : I have a good ear for music.
               Let us have the spoons and the bones.
            TITANIA : And what would you like to eat?
            BOTTOM : A bag of hay, or I could munch on oats.
               I think I’d prefer hay. Good hay, sweet hay.
               There’s nothing like it.
            TITANIA : I have an adventurous fairy who will get
               nuts for you, from a squirrel’s stash.
            BOTTOM : I would rather have some dried peas.
               But for now, let no fairies disturb me.
               I am suddenly very sleepy.
            TITANIA : Sleep, then. I will hold you in my arms.

          A MIDSUMMER NIGHT’S DREAM




          OBERON (coming forward): Welcome, Puck!
             Do you see this sweet sight?
             I now begin to pity her foolish love.
             A while ago, I met her in the wood,
             Seeking sweet favors for this hateful fool.
             I had an argument with her about it.
             She’d put a crown of fresh and fragrant
               flowers on his hairy head.
             Beads of dew stood
             Within the pretty little flowers’ eyes,
             Like tears crying about their own disgrace.
             When I told her what I thought,
             She begged me mildly not to tease her so.
             I then asked her about the child, which

                 she gave me right away.
               A fairy carried him to my chamber in
                 Fairyland.
               And now that I have the boy, I will undo
               The magic that I placed on her eyes.
               Now, gentle Puck, take this donkey’s head
               Off the head of this Athenian man.
               Let him awake when the others do.
               May all go back to Athens and think no
                 more about this night’s events.
               Let them see it all as a dream.
               But first I will set free the fairy queen.
               (touching Titania’s eyes): Be as you used to be.
               See as you used to see.
               This sweet bud shall have the power
               To undo the magic of Cupid’s flower.
               Now, wake up, my sweet queen!
            TITANIA : My Oberon! What a dream I had!
               I thought I loved a donkey!
            OBERON (pointing to Bottom): There lies your love.
            TITANIA : How did these things come to pass?
               Oh, how I hate the sight of him now!
            OBERON : Silence awhile. Puck, take off his head.

            (Puck removes the donkey’s head from Bottom’s
            shoulders.)
               Titania, call for music. As for these five
                mortals, let them think they’ve been
                sleeping all night.

          TITANIA : Let’s have music to charm their sleep.
          OBERON : Play, music. Come, my queen,
             Hold my hand, and
             Rock the ground on which these sleepers lie.
          (Music plays. Oberon and Titania dance.)
             Now you and I are like new friends.
             Tomorrow at midnight we will dance in
               triumph at Duke Theseus’s house.
             We shall bless the house for the future.
             And there, these two pairs of lovers,
             Will happily be wedded.
          PUCK : Fairy king, listen and hear:
             A lark tells us that morning is near.
          OBERON : Come, my queen, just like the moon,
             Let’s fly around the earth so soon.
          TITANIA : Come, my husband, and in our flight,
             Tell me what happened this night.
             Why was I, sleeping, to be found,
             With these mortals on the ground?
          (Oberon, Titania, and Puck exit. A horn sounds.
          Theseus, his servants, Hippolyta, and Egeus enter.)
          THESEUS : Go, one of you! Find the man
             Who takes care of the forest and its
              animals.
             The May Day rite is finished,
             And it is still early enough to go hunting.

            (A servant exits.)
               (to Hippolyta): We will go, fair queen.
               On the mountaintop we will hear the
                 music
               Of dogs and their echo joined together.
            HIPPOLYTA : I was with Hercules once
               Hunting in the woods of Crete. They used
                 dogs of Sparta to hunt for bear.
               Never have I heard such wonderful sounds!
               The trees, the skies, the fountains, and
                 every place nearby
               Echoed together. I never heard
               So musical a sound! Such sweet thunder!
            THESEUS : My dogs are that same kind, with
               Hanging jowls and sand-colored coats.
               Their heads are hung with long ears that
               Sweep away the morning dew.
               And their voices are matched like bells,
               Each tuned to each. A cry more musical
                 was never cheered on with hunter’s horn.
               Judge when you hear.
            (He sees the sleeping mortals.)
               But, look! Who is this?
            EGEUS : My lord, this is my daughter here asleep.
               And these are Lysander and Demetrius.
               This is Helena, old Nedar’s daughter.

             I wonder why they are here together.
          THESEUS : No doubt they rose up early to watch
             The May Day rite. They must have heard
             That we planned to watch it
             And came here to be with us.
             But speak, Egeus. Isn’t this the day
             That Hermia must tell you of her choice?
          EGEUS : It is, my lord.
          THESEUS (to a servant): Go, have the hunters
             Wake them with their horns.
          (A servant exits. A shout is heard from offstage. Horns
          sound. The sleepers awake and kneel to Theseus.)
             Good morning, friends. Valentine’s is past.
             Do these birds just start to pair off now?
          LYSANDER : Pardon, my lord.
          THESEUS : Please, all of you, stand up.

          (They rise.)
             (to Lysander and Demetrius): I know you two
               are rival enemies.
             How, with your feelings of jealousy,
             Can you sleep so close and fear no danger?
          LYSANDER : My lord, I am still half-asleep.
             I am amazed at this. Yet, I swear,
             I cannot truly say how I came to be here.
             For I believe—in fact, I know—that
             I came here with Hermia. We planned

               To leave Athens and go where we might
               Be free from Athenian law—
            EGEUS : My lord, you’ve heard enough!
               I beg you, bring the law upon his head.
               If they had run away, Demetrius,
               They would have cheated you and me.
               You of your wife, and me of my consent—
               My consent that she should be your wife.
            DEMETRIUS : My lord, Helena told me their plans.
               In anger I followed them. Helena followed
                 me. Now I don’t know what power—
               But some power it is—made my love for
                 Hermia melt like the snow. Now it seems
               Like the memory of some toy
               I loved when I was a child.
               Today, my love, my heart, and my feelings
               Belong only to Helena. To her, my lord,
               I was engaged before I saw Hermia.
               But, like a sickness, I turned from her.
               Now, as in health, I have come back to her.
               Now I want her, love her, and long for her,
               And will be forever true to her.
            THESEUS : Fair lovers, you are lucky we found
                you. We will hear more from you later.
               Egeus, I must rule against your will.
               For in the temple, by and by, with us
               These couples shall be wed.
               And, as the morning is flying by,

             Our hunting trip shall be set aside.
             Come with us to Athens, all of you.
             We’ll stand together, three by three,
             What a joyful wedding it will be!
             Come, Hippolyta.
          (Theseus, Hippolyta, Egeus, and servants exit.)
          DEMETRIUS : These things seem like far-off
              mountains that are only clouds.
          HERMIA : I see these things with a sleepy eye,
             And everything seems double.
          HELENA : I think the same.
             And I have found Demetrius, like a jewel,
             Mine, and yet not mine.
          DEMETRIUS : Are you sure
             That we are awake? It seems to me
             That we are still sleeping and dreaming.
             Do you think the duke was just here,
             And told us to follow him?
          HERMIA : Yes, and my father.
          HELENA : And Hippolyta.
          LYSANDER : And he told us to follow them to
              the temple.

             And along the way, let us tell our dreams.

                me, and I will answer. My next line is
                “Most fair Pyramus.” Hello? Peter Quince?
                Flute, the bellows-mender? Snout, the
                tinker? Starveling? God’s my life! They
                left me here asleep! I have had a most rare
                vision, a dream that even I can’t explain!
                I thought I was—and I thought I had—
                Any man is a fool if he tries to say what
                I thought I had. The eye of man has not
                heard it. The ear of man has not seen it.
                Man’s hand is not able to taste it. His
                tongue cannot think of it. His heart
                cannot feel what my dream was. I will get
                Peter Quince to write a ballad about this
                dream. It shall be called “Bottom’s Dream”
                because it has no bottom. I will sing it
                for the duke toward the end of the play.
            (Bottom exits.)

            (Quince, Flute, Snout, and Starveling enter Peter
            Quince’s house in Athens.)
            QUINCE : Have you sent anyone to Bottom’s
                house? Is he home yet?
            STARVELING : He hasn’t been heard from. No
                doubt something has happened to him.

          FLUTE : If he doesn’t come, the play is ruined.
              It can’t go on, can it?
          QUINCE : It is not possible. No man in all
              of Athens is able to play Pyramus but
              Bottom.
          FLUTE : I agree. He is simply the most talented
              working man in Athens.
          QUINCE : Yes, and the best-looking, too.
             He has the sweetest voice!
          (Snug enters.)
          SNUG : Masters, the duke is coming. And there
              are more lords and ladies who were just
              married. If our play had gone on, we’d
              have made a fortune.
          FLUTE : Oh, Bottom! He just lost sixpence a
              day for the rest of his life. He could not
              have escaped it. If the duke had not
              given him sixpence a day for playing
              Pyramus, I’ll be hanged! He would have
              deserved it, too.
          (Bottom enters.)
          BOTTOM : Where are my friends?
          QUINCE : Bottom! Oh, great day! Oh, most
             happy hour!
          BOTTOM : Masters, I have wonders to tell you.
             But don’t ask me about them! If I tell

                you everything, right as it fell out.
            QUINCE : Let us hear, sweet Bottom.
            BOTTOM : Not a word from me. All that I will
                say is that the duke is coming. Get your
                costumes together and tie up your
                beards! Meet at the palace. Every man
                look over his part. Let Thisbe wear clean
                clothes. And don’t let the lion cut his
                nails, for they must hang out as the lion’s
                claws. And, most dear actors, eat no
                onions or garlic. This is a sweet comedy,

                   ACT

                    5                    Scene 1


          (Theseus, Hippolyta, Philostrate, lords, and
          servants enter the palace of Theseus in Athens.)
          HIPPOLYTA : My Theseus, it is a strange
             Story that these lovers speak of.
          THESEUS : More strange than true.
             I don’t believe in fairy tales.
             Lovers and madmen have such seething
               brains. They have more fantasies than
             Cool reason ever understands.
             The lunatic, the lover, and the poet
             Have a lot in common.
             The madman sees more devils than vast
               hell can hold—the lover, just as crazy,
             Sees Helen’s beauty in the plainest face.
             The poet’s eye rolls from heaven to earth,
             From earth to heaven. His imagination
             Brings forth wonders and his pen gives them
               shape with homes and names.
             Strong imagination plays such tricks! If you
             Imagine some joy, then there is imagined
             Some bringer of that joy.

               Or in the night, imagining some fear,
               How easily a bush can seem like a bear!
            HIPPOLYTA : But all the stories they told
               Are so alike! Their minds saw the same
                fantasy. It seems like more than just
                imagination.
            (Lysander, Demetrius, Hermia, and Helena enter.)
            THESEUS : Here come the lovers, full of joy and
                happiness. Joy to you, gentle friends.
               May joy and fresh days of love follow you
               And remain in your hearts!
            LYSANDER : More to you than to us!
            THESEUS : Come, now. What plays and dances
               Shall we have to while away these hours
               Between our supper and bedtime?
               Come, Philostrate, tell us!
            (Philostrate comes forward.)
            PHILOSTRATE : Yes, lord.
            THESEUS : Say, what entertainment do you have
                for this evening? What play?
               What music? How shall we spend
               This lazy time, if not with some delight?
            PHILOSTRATE (handing Theseus a paper): Here,
                mighty Theseus, is a list of all who are
                here this evening to bring you joy with
                music or other entertainment. Choose
                the one you like the best.

          A MIDSUMMER NIGHT’S DREAM



          THESEUS (reading from the list): “The battle with
              the centaurs,
             To be sung by an Athenian with a harp.”
             We’ll have none of that.
             “The riot of the drunken party-goers,
             Attacking the singer in their rage.”
             That is an old play. I have already seen it.
             “The three muses mourning for the death
             Of learning.” That is a sharp satire.
             Not suitable for a wedding day.
             “A tedious brief scene of young Pyramus
             And his love Thisbe. A tragic comedy.”
             A tragic comedy? Tedious and brief?
             That is like “hot ice.” It doesn’t make
               sense. What does this mean?
          PHILOSTRATE : If this play had only ten words,
             It would be too long, my lord.
             The words are what makes it tedious, for
             In the whole play, there isn’t one good word!
             My noble lord, it is tragic
             Because Pyramus kills himself in the play.
             When I saw it rehearsed, I must say,
             It made my eyes water. But my tears
             Came from loud laughter.
          THESEUS : Who are the actors?
          PHILOSTRATE : Hard-working men of Athens,
             Who never labored with thought until now.
             It’s especially for your wedding day.

            THESEUS : So we will hear it.
            PHILOSTRATE : No, my noble lord,
               It is not for you. I have seen it already,
               And it is not worth seeing.
            THESEUS : I will hear that play.
               For nothing can be wrong if it is done
               With simple good wishes. Go, bring them
                 in. And take your places, ladies.
            (Philostrate exits.)
            HIPPOLYTA : I hate to see people embarrassed
               By trying to do something they can’t.
            THESEUS : Why, gentle sweet, you shall see no
                such thing!
            HIPPOLYTA : But he says the play is terrible.
            THESEUS : Let us be kind and thank the actors.
               Good efforts by sincere people mean a lot
                 to me.
            (Philostrate enters again.)
            PHILOSTRATE : Your grace, the actors are ready.
            THESEUS : Let them begin.

            Snug, and Starveling enter.)
            QUINCE (reciting the prologue): If we offend, it is

                beginning of our end.

             We do not come, as wanting to please you,
             Our true intent is. All for your delight
             We are not here. That you should feel sorry
             The actors are here. By their show,
             You shall know all that you want to know.
          THESEUS : This fellow does not make any sense.
          LYSANDER : He says his lines like a rough colt.
             He doesn’t know where to stop.
             A good lesson, my lord: It is not enough
               just to speak. You must try to speak true.
          HIPPOLYTA : He talks like a child playing a flute.
             He makes noise, but it’s all confused.
          THESEUS : His speech was like a tangled
              chain—nothing broken, but all mixed
              up. Who is next?
          QUINCE (continuing the prologue): Gentle persons,
              perhaps you wonder about this show,
             But wonder on until truth makes all
               things plain.
             This man is Pyramus, if you must know.
             Thisbe is the beautiful lady.
             This man is the Wall, through which these
                 lovers whisper.
             This man is Moonlight. You must know
             By moonlight did these lovers meet
             At Ninus’s tomb, there to woo.
             This is the Lion that scared Thisbe away.
             As she ran, her coat fell to the ground.

               The lion tore it with his bloody mouth.
               Along came Pyramus, a sweet and tall youth.
               He found his beloved Thisbe’s bloody coat.
               With a blade, he bravely stabbed his
                 burning breast.
               And Thisbe, hiding in the shade nearby,
               Drew his dagger out, and killed herself.
               Let Lion, Moonlight, Wall, and lovers two
               Tell the whole story through and through.
            THESEUS : I wonder if the Lion will speak.
            DEMETRIUS : I wouldn’t be surprised, my lord.
               One lion may, if many donkeys do.
            SNOUT (as the Wall): In this play, I, Snout,
               Do play a Wall that has a hole. Through
                 this hole,
               The lovers, Pyramus and Thisbe,
               Did whisper often, and very secretly.
               This plaster and this stone do show
               That I am that Wall. The truth is so.
            THESEUS : Could a real wall speak any better?
            DEMETRIUS : It is the cleverest wall I have ever
                heard, my lord!

               Oh, night, which always is when day is not!
               Oh, night! Oh, night! Alas, alas, alas!
               I fear that Thisbe has forgotten her promise.

              And you, oh, sweet and lovely Wall,
              That stands between her father’s land
              and mine,

             Thanks, Wall. May the gods protect you!
             But what do I see? No Thisbe do I see.
             Oh, curse you, wicked Wall, for lying to me!
          THESEUS : The Wall should curse back.
          BOTTOM : No, truly, sir, he should not.
             “Lying to me” is Thisbe’s cue.
             She will enter now, And I will see her
               through the Wall. You’ll see. It will

              look through the Wall
             To see if I can hear my Thisbe’s face.

            DEMETRIUS : Well roared, Lion!
            THESEUS : Well run, Thisbe!
            HIPPOLYTA : Well shone, Moon!

            (Bottom enters. Snug exits.)
            DEMETRIUS : Here comes Pyramus.
            LYSANDER : That’s why the Lion left.
            BOTTOM (as Pyramus): Sweet Moon, I thank you
               For your sunny light.
               I thank you, Moon, for shining bright.
               I trust you to bring Thisbe to my sight.
               But wait! Oh, no!
               What dreadful sadness is here?
               Eyes, do you see? How can it be?
               Oh, sweet duck! Oh, dear!
               You coat so good—
               What? Stained with blood?

          A MIDSUMMER NIGHT’S DREAM



             Come near, oh, terrible gods!
             Cut the thread of my life! Crush me!
             End me! Let me die!
          THESEUS : This strong feeling,
             And the death of a dear friend,
             Would indeed make a man look sad.
          HIPPOLYTA : Curse my heart, but I pity the man!
          BOTTOM (as Pyramus): Oh, Nature, why did you
              make lions?
             A vile lion has eaten my dear.
             She is—no, no—she was the fairest lady
             That ever loved and looked with cheer.
             Come, tears! Destroy me!
             Out, sword, and wound me!
             Cut the left side of Pyramus
             Where his heart does beat.
             (He pretends to stab himself.)
             So I die, like so, like so, like so.
             Now I am dead. Now I have fled.
             My soul is in the sky.
             Tongue, lose your light!
             Moon, make your flight.
          (Starveling, as Moonlight, exits.)
             Now die, die, die, die, die.
          (Bottom, as Pyramus, pretends to die.)
          HIPPOLYTA : Why does Moonlight leave before
               Thisbe comes back and finds her lover?

            (Flute, as Thisbe, enters again.)
            THESEUS : She will find him by the stars.
               Look! Here she comes.
               Her speech ends the play.
            HIPPOLYTA : I hope she will be brief. Such a
                Pyramus doesn’t deserve a long speech.
            LYSANDER : She has seen him already
               With those sweet eyes.
            DEMETRIUS : And so she cries, as follows:
            FLUTE (as Thisbe): Asleep, my love?
               What, dead, my dove?
               Oh, Pyramus, arise!
               Speak, speak! Quite dumb?
               Dead, dead? A tomb
               Must cover your sweet eyes.
               These white lips, this cherry-red nose,
               These yellow cheeks are gone, are gone!
               Lovers, cry with me!
               His eyes were green as leeks.
               Oh, death, come to me
               With hands as pale as milk.
               Lay them in blood.
               Tongue, not a word.
               Come, happy sword;
               Come, blade, soak my breast in blood.
            (She pretends to stab herself.)
               Now farewell, friends.

             So Thisbe ends.
             Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye!
          (She pretends to die.)
          THESEUS : Moonlight and Lion are left to bury
             the dead.
          DEMETRIUS : Yes, and Wall, too.

          (Bottom and Flute stand up.)
          BOTTOM : No, I promise you. Their fathers have
             Torn down the wall that parted them.
             Would you like to see the epilogue?
             Or would you rather hear us dance?
          THESEUS : No epilogue, please. Your play needs
              no explanation. Never explain.
             When the players are dead, none is to blame.
             If the writer had played Pyramus
             And hanged himself with Thisbe’s stocking,
             It would have been a fine tragedy.
             And so it is, and very well-performed.
             But, come, let’s see your dance.
             Forget the epilogue.
          (The players dance, and exit.)
             The iron tongue of midnight has rung 12.
             Lovers, to bed! It’s almost fairy time.
             I fear we will sleep too late in the morning
             Because we have stayed up so late tonight.
             This play goes well with this night’s slow

                pace. Sweet friends, to bed!
               Two weeks from now, once more let’s meet.
               We’ll celebrate with another feast.
            (All exit. Puck enters, with a broom.)
            PUCK : Now the hungry lion roars,
               And the wolf howls at the moon.
               Now the tired farmer snores,
               With his weary work all done.
               Now the firelight burns low.
               Now the night owl, with its cry,
               Reminds the man who lies in woe
               That someday he will have to die.
               Now it is the time of night
               For the graves to open wide.
               Each one lets out its sprite.
               In the dark paths they will glide.
               And we fairies now will run
               By the moonlight’s shining beam.
               We flee the presence of the sun,
               Following darkness like a dream.
               Now we play. Not a mouse
               Shall disturb this happy house.
               I’ve been sent with broom before,
               To sweep the dust behind the door.
            (Oberon and Titania enter, with their fairies.)
            OBERON (to the fairies): Give glimmering light.

             Every elf and fairy sprite
             Hop as light as bird from briar.
             Sing this song, after me,
             Sing and dance—one, two, three!
          TITANIA : Let the music gently float.
             For each word, a musical note.
             Hand in hand, with fairy grace,
             We will sing and bless this place.
          (Oberon leads the fairies in song and dance.)
          OBERON : Now, until the break of day,
             Through this house we’ll go our way.
             We’ll visit every bride and groom
             And bless the air in every room.
             Bless the children they create,
             And make them always fortunate.
             So shall all the couples three
             Ever true in loving be.
             And ugly marks from Nature’s hand
             Shall not in their children stand.
             With this magic fairy dew,
             Bless this palace, through and through.
             Through each room shall fairies race
             Bringing peace to this sweet place.
             And the owner of it, blessed,
             Always shall in safety rest.
             Dance away without delay.
             Meet me all by break of day.

            (All but Puck exit.)
            PUCK : If we players have offended,
               Think just this, and all is mended:
               That you have been sleeping here
               While these visions did appear.
               And this weak and silly theme,
               Means no more than just a dream.
               Good people, do not hiss and boo.
               Pardon! We’ll make it up to you.
               And, as I am an honest Puck,
               If we have somehow had the luck
               To escape your angry tongue,
               We’ll mend what’s wrong before too long.
               Or else the Puck a liar call.
               So, goodnight unto you all.
               Give me your hands, if we be friends,
               And Puck will soon make amends.
